Rules of Play

Each game of bowling consists of ten frames. In each frame, the bowler will have two chances to
knock down as many pins as possible with their bowling ball. In games with more than one
bowler, as is common, every bowler will take their frame in a predetermined order before the
next frame begins. If a bowler knocks down all ten pins with their first ball, he is awarded a strike.
If the bowler knocks down all 10 pins with the two balls of a frame, it is known as a spare. Bonus
points are awarded for both a strike and a spare. The bonus points awarded depend on what is
scored in the next 2 balls (for a strike) or 1 ball (for a spare). If the bowler knocks down all 10 pins
in the tenth frame, the bowler is allowed to throw 3 balls for that frame. This allows for a
potential of 12 strikes in a single game, and a maximum score of 300 points, a perfect game.

Scoring

In general, one point is scored for each pin that is knocked over. For example, if a player bowls
over three pins with the first shot, then six with the second, the player would receive a total of
nine points for that frame. If a player knocks down nine pins with the first shot, but misses with
the second, the player would also score nine. When a player fails to knock down all ten pins after
their second ball it is known as an open frame. In the event that all ten pins are knocked over by
a player in a single frame, bonuses are awarded.
